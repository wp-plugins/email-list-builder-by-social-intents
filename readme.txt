== Description ==
Email List Builder by Social Intents lets you quickly add an email list signup form to any page to allow visitors to join your email list.  Instead of a sidebar widget, our mailing list builder brings extra attention by popping up
a modal signup form. It can be configured to display on a particular page, or after a specified time on a page.  Add your CSS, your language, your background images, and your style to the form.  It's one of the fastest and most effective ways to build your email lists.
